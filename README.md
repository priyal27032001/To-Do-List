A new day list can be created on adding a new route.

On adding the new route a new page with the name same as the route is created. 
The list for the new day is initially empty.

Although, if the route with the same name already exists new route is not created, the site is redirected to the already existing route.

No matter how the route is written the heading will always be capitalized. So, its not case sensitive.
